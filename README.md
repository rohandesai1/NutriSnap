# **NutriSnap**
Welcome to the Food Nutrition Detector! This project offers an effective way for users to capture photos of their food and retrieve nutritional data about it. Powered by custom Convolutional Neural Networks, along with various other Python libraries, the goal is to make tracking your food intake as effortless as taking a snapshot.
